#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop, test and maintain high quality software systems.

It is important as it ensures that software systems are: 
-Reliable-Ensuring that software works as expected, without bias.
-Efficient- Optimising developer workflows while maintaining high-quality standards. 
-Scalable and flexible- Allowing systems to handle increased loads without performance loss.
-Secure- By implementing practices like authentication, authorisation, and encryption to protect user data


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Mastering complexity- Early software systems were simple, but as projects grew, complexity became a challenge. Techniques like modularity, abstraction, and design patterns emerged to help developers break large systems into manageable pieces.
-Mastering Process- To handle growing project sizes and team coordination, structured methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps were introduced. These processes improved collaboration, quality assurance, and delivery timelines.
-Mastering Machine- As hardware evolved, software engineering adapted to leverage increased computing power. Developers learned to optimize performance, parallelism, and resource management to build faster, more efficient applications.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements :Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
-Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment: Releasing the software to user of customer.
-Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall Methodology: A rigid, linear process where each phase must finish before the next begins, making changes difficult and delaying feedback and testing until the end.
-Agile Methodology: A flexible, iterative approach with frequent sprints, continuous testing, and regular customer feedback to adapt quickly to evolving requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
-Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential for streamlining development by combining tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. They enhance productivity with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection. Examples include Visual Studio, PyCharm, and Eclipse.
-Version Control Systems (VCS) help teams track and manage code changes, making collaboration easier and reducing the risk of data loss. They enable branching, merging, and maintaining a history of revisions. Examples include Git and platforms like GitHub and GitLab.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing Requirements: Requirements tend to change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
   Solution:Engineers can use agile development for iterative progress and adaptability, and 
   modular design to enhance flexibility by dividing systems into independent, manageable 
   parts.
-Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on required schedules tends to result in rushed development and compromised quality
   Solution: An adoption of agile methodologies to streamline the flow of work, allowing large 
   projects to be broken down into manageable sprints
-Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase costs
   Solution: Refactoring Cycles by allocating time in each sprint to clean up code, improve 
   structure, and optimize performance.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Tetsing: is the testing of individual components or modules of software
**Importance** It helps to ensure that each unit performs its intended function correctly
-Integration Testing: is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems
**Importance** Makes sure that data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected
-System Testing: is testing the entire software system as a whole
**Importance** helps with verifying that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements
-Acceptance Testing: is testing yje software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
**Importance** Checks whether the software meets the needs of thed end-user and if it ready to be deployed


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance of AI interactions:
-Accuracy & Clarity: Well-designed prompts reduce ambiguity, leading to more precise answers.
-Efficiency: Good prompts minimize back-and-forth adjustments, saving time and effort.
-Customization: Tailored prompts allow users to extract specific insights or generate content 
 that aligns with their goals.
-Unlocking Capabilities: Proper prompts can help AI models perform complex tasks, from creative 
 writing to solving technical problems.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:
Tell me about finance.

Improved prompt:
Explain the basics of personal finance, including budgeting, saving, and investing, in simple terms for beginners.

Why the improved prompt is more effective:
The improved prompt is: 
-clearer and more specific â€” it narrows the topic to personal finance and outlines key areas of interest (budgeting, saving, investing). 
-It also defines the desired tone and audience (simple terms for beginners), helping the AI tailor the response more accurately.
